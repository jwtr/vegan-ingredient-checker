# Vegan Ingredient Checker

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/9e5b0244-fed0-4dce-88ca-6ba64c5ca338/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/vegan-ingredient-checker/deploys)

A quick 20-minute app to try out [ViteJS](https://vitejs.dev) and continuous deployment with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com).

Utilising the [Is-Vegan](https://github.com/hmontazeri/is-vegan) package, the app checks ingredient lists and warns of any non-vegan items.

Basic in functionality, simple in design, does the job.
